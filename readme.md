After opening the index.html file in the browser and opening dev tools, I found an error message in the console that read "ShowGlobal is undefined."

I had read that code a few times, and had an inkling that "ShowGlobal" had a typo or was called wrong. This has happened to me a few times, when I've tried to call a function without defining the variable, or if I pass the wrong variable into a function.

I went back to the code, and saw that sure enough, there was a typo. I fixed the typo, saved the file, and refreshed Chrome. The error message is gone.
